title: L-Shapes of a Numerical Semigroup
---

In the [repository](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/LShapes) we describe two methods to display L-Shapes of numerical semigroups with embeddin dimension four (see [On the number of L-shapes in embedding dimension four numerical semigroups](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X15001922)).
