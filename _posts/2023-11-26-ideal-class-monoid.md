title: Ideal Class Monoid of a Numerical Semigroup
---

In this [repository](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid) we present the tools needed to develop the examples in the papers 
  - L. Casabella, M. D'Anna, P. A. García-Sánchez, Apéry sets and the ideal class monoid of a numerical semigroup, [Mediterr. J. Math. 21:7 (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00009-023-02550-8); [arxiv.org/2302.09647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09647)
  - P. A. García-Sánchez, The isomorphism problem for ideal class monoids of numerical semigroups (to appear in Semigroup Forum), [arXiv:2311.15265](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15265).

The notebook [ideal-class-monoid](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/class-monoid.ipynb) contains the necessary code (written using the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package [numericalsgps](https://gap-packages.github.io/numericalsgps/)), together with some examples extracted from the first paper. The notebook [isomorphism-ideal-class-monoid](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/isomorphism-ideal-class-monoid.ipynb) contains examples for the second manuscript.
