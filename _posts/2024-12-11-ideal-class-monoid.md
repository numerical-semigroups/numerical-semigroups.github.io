title: Ideal Class Monoid of a Numerical Semigroup
---

In this [repository](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid) we present the tools needed to develop the examples in the papers 

- L. Casabella, M. D'Anna, P. A. García-Sánchez, Apéry sets and the ideal class monoid of a numerical semigroup, [Mediterr. J. Math. 21:7 (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00009-023-02550-8); [arxiv.org/2302.09647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09647),
- P. A. García-Sánchez, The isomorphism problem for ideal class monoids of numerical semigroups, [Semigroup Forum (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00233-024-10429-7), [arXiv:2311.15265](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15265).
- S. Bonzio, P. A. García-Sánchez, The poset of normalized ideals of numerical semigroups with multiplicity three, [arXiv:2407.21697](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21697).
- S. Bonzio, P. A. García-Sánchez, When the poset of the ideal class monoid of a numerical semigroup is a lattice, [arXiv:2412.07281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07281).

The notebook [ideal-class-monoid](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/class-monoid.ipynb) contains the necessary code (written using the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package [numericalsgps](https://gap-packages.github.io/numericalsgps/)), together with some examples extracted from the first manuscript. The notebook [isomorphism-ideal-class-monoid](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/isomorphism-ideal-class-monoid.ipynb) contains examples for the second manuscript. The file [poset-normalized-ideal](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/poset-normalized-ideals.ipynb) contains examples and the code needed for the poset of normalized ideals of a numerical semigroup with multiplicity three, while the file [lattice-normaliced-ideals-ns](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/lattice-normalized-ideals-ns.ipynb) has computations dealing with when this poset is a latticd.
