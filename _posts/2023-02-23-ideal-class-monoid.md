title: Ideal Class Monoid of a Numerical Semigroup
---

In this [repository](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid) we present the tools needed to develop the examples in the paper 
  - L. Casabella, M. D'Anna, P. A. García-Sánchez, Apéry sets and the ideal class monoid of a numerical semigroup, [arxiv.org/2302.09647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09647).

The notebook [ideal-class-monoid](https://github.com/numerical-semigroups/ideal-class-monoid/blob/main/class%20monoid.ipynb) contains the necessary code (written using the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package [numericalsgps](https://gap-packages.github.io/numericalsgps/)), together with some examples extracted from the above manuscript.
